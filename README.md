# CuteCakes Website 

Welcome to the CuteCakes project. This is my very first project as an assignment for the Bootcamp Full Stack Developer course by GeeksHubs. The project's aim was to dive into the functionality and practice the very basics of HTML and CSS.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main files and directories:

- `index.html`: The main homepage of the website.
- `menu.html`: The menu page showcasing the available cupcakes and prices.
- `contact.html`: The contact page with contact information and a contact form.
- `locations.html`: To possibly be added later.
- `about.html`: To possibly be added later.
- `css/`: Directory containing the CSS files for styling the website.
  - `body.css`
  - `header.css`
  - `main.css`
  - `footer.css`
  - `home.css`
  - `menu.css`
  - `contact.css`
  - `locations.css`
  - `about.css`
- `img/`: Directory containing the images used in the website.
  - `LogoCuteCakes.png`
  - `PrideCupcake.png`
  - `Cupcakes/` (subdirectory with individual cupcake images)
  - `Socials/` (subdirectory with social media icons)

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 4.4.1
- jQuery 3.4.1
- Popper.js 1.16.0

## How to Use

You can view the website simply by following the link: [mandyspaan.github.io/CuteCakes_BasicWebsite](https://mandyspaan.github.io/CuteCakes_BasicWebsite/)

Or by cloning the repository to your device:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cutecakes-website.git
   cd cutecakes-website
   ```
2. **Open the `index.html` file** in your web browser to view the homepage.

## Page Descriptions

### `index.html`

This is the main landing page for CuteCakes. It includes:

- A header with a navigation bar.
- A section about CuteCakes and their offerings.
- A highlight of the cupcake of the month.
- A footer with links to the contact page, locations, and menu.

### `menu.html`

This page lists the available cupcakes, each with an image and description. It also includes prices.

### `contact.html`

This page provides contact information, including social media links and a phone number. It also contains a contact form.

### `locations-html` & `about.html`

These two pages do not contain content yet. They were not part of the requierements for the assigned project. I created them in case I would have had extra time before reaching the deadline, but have not been able to get to it.

## CSS Descriptions

I tried to add structure and a clear overview of the css files by organizing the code chronologically within each file and by linking the css files to each html page as followed:

- body.css
- header.css
- main.css
- [current-page].css
- footer.css

## External Libraries

The project uses the following external libraries:

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/)

The external CSS and JS files are linked in the HTML files using CDNs.

## Points of improvement

### Overall

- Add the content for location.html and about.html
- Make the layout more visually appealing
- Finetune the responsive design

### `index.html`

- Add more sections:
  - News like a new location opened and a link to the locations page
  - A preview and link to the about page

### `menu.html`

- Finetune the layout of the menu container
- Include the cupcake of the month

### `contact.html`

- Find a way to not have the option of scrolling down only because the footer is there
- Make the layout for desktop more visually appealing
