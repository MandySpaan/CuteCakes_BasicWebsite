## Page Descriptions

### `index.html`

This is the main landing page for CuteCakes. It includes:

- A header with a navigation bar.
- A section about CuteCakes and their offerings.
- A highlight of the cupcake of the month.
- A footer with links to the contact page, locations, and menu.

### `menu.html`

This page lists the available cupcakes, each with an image and description. It also includes the pricing information.

### `contact.html`

This page provides contact information, including social media links and a phone number. It also contains a contact form.

### `locations-html` & `about.html`

These two pages do not contain content yet. They were not part of the requierements for the assigned project. I created them in case I would have had extra time before reaching the deadline, but have not been able to get to it.
